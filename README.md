# Fractal Viewer

Colorful visualizer for fractals generated by simple dynamical systems on the complex plane.

Note this is a toy project and shouldn't be used for serious mathematical investigation.

## Motivation

I saw a program that generated fractal pictures in a lecture and thought it would be nice to make one to poke around with myself.

## Implementation Notes

I study enough pure math to find these sorts of things but not enough to improve my naive implementation significantly.

There are, however, a few things I know how to optimize and plan on implementing at some point:

1. **Real parallelization:** A large number of pixels are computed individually, which is clearly suboptimal. There are currently web workers splitting this up a little bit, but I suspect that are ways to vectorize most of the computation or possibly leverage GPU operations without excessive hastle.

2. **Improve precision:** The colors are computed with an "escape time" approximated with the minimum number of iterations to literally escape a particular bound. My particular implementation leads to a discrete coloring with some circular shapes that shouldn't be there. I have some vague ideas but have yet to draw up a concrete plan for fixing this. I likely need to do some more searching around.

3. **Apparent speed:** This has a large intersection with the **Real parallelization** optimization but they are not entirely the same. It would *feel* faster if every 64x64 block of pixels were computed and colored, then every 32x32 block (reusing the 64x64 for 1/4 of the new blocks), ... until every pixel is computed. This is slower than just computing every pixel, but it would look much cooler and is probably more fun to implement.
